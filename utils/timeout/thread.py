'''
    thread_timeout decorator allows to run piece of the python code
    safely regardless of TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE issues ('D' state).

    Main sources of 'D' state are broken NFS, bad disk/IO, or kernel bugs.

    Library provides single decorator, adding a timeout for the function call.


    Example of the usage:
        import thread_timeout

        @thread_timeout(10, kill=False)
        def NFS_read(path):
            file(path, 'r').read()

        try:
            print("Result: %s" % NFS_read('/broken_nfs/file'))
        except ExecTimeout:
            print ("NFS seems to be hung")

    Example of the function call usage:

        def NFS_read(path):
            file(path, 'r').read()

        try:
            result = thread_timeout_call(NFS_read, 10, kill=False,
                                         args=('/broken_nfs/file',))
            print("Result: %s" % result)
        except ExecTimeout:
            print ("NFS seems to be hung")



    thread_timeout/thread_timeout_call works by running specified
    function in separate thread and waiting for timeout (or finalization)
    of the thread to return value or raise exception.
    If thread is not finished before timeout, thread_timeout will
    try to terminate thread according to kill value (see below).

    thread_timeout(timeout, kill=True, kill_wait=0.1)

    thread_timeout_call(func, timeout, kill=True, kill_wait=0.1,
                        args=tuple(), kwargs=dict())

    timeout - seconds, floating, how long to wait thread.
    kill - if True (default) attempt to terminate thread with function
    kill_wait - how long to wait after killing before reporting
    an unresponsive thread

    THREAD KILLING

    Thread killing implemented on python level: it will terminate python
    code, but will not terminate any IO operations or subprocess calls.

    Exceptions:

    ExecTimeout - function did not finish on time, timeout
        (base class for all following exceptions)
    KilledExecTimeout - there was a timeout and thread
        with function was killed successfully
    FailedKillExecTimeout - there was a timeout and kill attempt
        but the thread refuses to die
    NotKillExecTimeout - there was a timeout and there
        was no attempt to kill thread
